// FA_Gate.v
// Gate-level model of a 1-bit full adder. No delays yet -- that starts in
// Task 2. This task is purely about gate ordering.
//
// Part (a): leave this file exactly as it is, compile, and simulate.
// Part (b): AFTER completing part (a), come back and reorder the five gate
//           instantiations below into any different sequence, then
//           re-simulate with the same tb.v and compare.
